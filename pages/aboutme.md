My name is Chen Jie (陈杰), and I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist Univresity. Before joining HKBU, I was a senior algorithm engineer at Omnivision Technologies Inc. Singapore, focusing on next generation HDR solutions. Before that, I was a research fellow at ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Laboratory, Singapore. I received the B.S. and the M. Eng degree both from  School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, and the Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

My research interests are in computational photography (systems and algorithms for light field/hyperspectral signal acquisition, compressed compressing and compression), computational and machine learning methods for image/video restoration (denoising, vision enhancement, super resolution, motion analysis), and 3D content modeling.
